FADE IN:
 
INT. RANDY AND SARA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (DAY 1)
 
LARRY
 snoops around the room while his wife, 
CHERYL
, sits 
patiently on the couch.
CHERYL
 
Larry, why do you always snoop around our 
friends' homes when they're not in the 
room?
Larry notices on a bookshelf a stuffed chimpanzee doll 
dressed in a military uniform.  He picks up the doll.
 
LARRY
What does this look like?... The uniform.  
Isn't this a Nazi uniform?
 
CHERYL
 
(rolling eyes)
 
Okay, Larry.
LARRY
Your friends are flaunting a Nazi monkey 
and you're "Okay, Larrying" me?
 
CHERYL
 
I hope they catch you.
 
LARRY
Bet you if I dig a little deeper I'd find 
an entire Gestapo Zoo.
 
CHERYL
 
It doesn't look like a Nazi, okay?
 
They hear faint voices coming from the other room.  Larry 
quickly puts back the doll.  
RANDY
 and his wife, 
SARA
, enter, 
carrying champagne glasses and a bottle of champagne.
 
SARA
 
Sorry we took so long.  You must think 
we're rude hosts.
 
CHERYL
 
Not at all, Sara.  No problem.
 
Sara hands Larry and Cheryl champagne glasses.  As Randy 
pours:
RANDY
Just want to make a special toast to 
Larry.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              2.
LARRY
Me?  You don't want to toast me.
Randy holds up his glass.
RANDY
Yes, you.  When I first became an animal 
wrangler, I had no idea our prized chimp, 
Jobo, would end up starring in a 
Weinstein war movie.  We owe it all to 
you.  To you, Larry.
As they clink champagne glasses:
LARRY
No, actually Jobo is the talent.
RANDY
But, if you hadn't introduced us to your 
manager, Jobo wouldn't be starring 
opposite Cuba Gooding.
 
LARRY
No, it’s just the right time.  Before 
Obama, you couldn’t get a black 
man/monkey script greenlit in the town.
 
CHERYL
 
Larry, be nice.
 
LARRY
What?  I’m just saying, another barrier 
broken.
SARA
 
Before we sit down for dinner, I want to 
show you two what I made.
 
Sara grabs the chimpanzee doll from the shelf.
CHERYL
 
(feigns surprise)
 
Oooh, how cute.  A little Jobo doll.
 
SARA
 
You like it?
CHERYL
 
It's adorable.
RANDY
That's a prototype.  Sara's gonna sell 
them in her gift shop.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              3.
SARA
 
And look, it salutes.
 
When Sara squeezes the stomach of the Jobo doll, it lifts its 
left arm straight out almost like a Nazi salute.
 
SARA
 
(off Larry's silence)
Uh, Larry... you like it?
 
As Sara squeezes the Jobo doll at Larry and it Nazi salutes:
LARRY
What?  Me?  Do I like it?
 
SARA
 
You don't like it.
 
LARRY
You kidding?  Too bad it’s a prototype, 
or I’d buy this off you right now.
 
SARA
 
Oh, no, take it.  It’s yours.
Sara tries giving it to Larry.
 
LARRY
No, I can't.  It’s yours.
 
As Sara forces the Jobo doll into Larry's hand:
RANDY
We insist.  Sara's making more.
 
LARRY
Thank you.
(squeezes the doll)
 
Thank you very much.
SARA
 
Oh, I think I hear the baby.
Sara exits.
 
LARRY
(mouths to Cheryl)
 
Baby?
Cheryl shrugs.
RANDY
Hey, let me give you two our new number.  
With all the publicity, we had to get it 
changed.

              4.
Larry takes out his cell phone.
 
LARRY
Great.  I'll put it in my spanking new 
Blackberry.  It has a touch screen 
thingy.
CHERYL
 
Really?  You're going to use that? You're 
not very technical.
LARRY
Oh, I'm technical.  Didn't I hook up our 
Tivo?
CHERYL
 
Yes, and that's why I'm saying you're not 
very technical.
 
LARRY
Okay, Randy, shoot.
RANDY
Five five five, four two six six.
 
LARRY
(enters the numbers)
Look at this.  I'm doing it.  And I'm 
putting you under Jobo.
Sara enters and in her arms is a chimpanzee, 
JOBO
.
SARA
 
(baby talk)
Guess who I found wide awake?
CHERYL
 
(baby talk)
Aw, it's Jobo.
SARA
 
(baby talk)
Say hi to Uncle Larry and Auntie Cheryl.  
Say hi, Jobo.
 
Sara waves Jobo's hand at the Davids.
CHERYL
 
(baby talk)
Hi, Jobo.
 
(then)
The kids at the Children's Hospital are 
going to love him.  Thanks for letting 
him perform.

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              5.
SARA
 
No, thank you. 
 
    (baby talk to Jobo)
It's good publicity for our little star. 
Jobo, say hi to Uncle Larry.
(puts her ear to Jobo)
 
What?  Jobo wants Uncle Larry to hold 
him?
 
LARRY
No, no.  Animals don't like me.
 
Sara practically forces Jobo into Larry's arms.
SARA
 
(baby talk)
Jobo no animal.  Jobo my baby.
 
LARRY
Well, Randy, you don't need a DNA test to 
know this one isn't yours.
 
SARA
 
(baby talk)
Larry, say hi, Jobo.  Say Hi, Jobo.
 
LARRY
No.  I don't talk to animals.  Nothing 
against the monkey.
Sara suddenly looks a bit miffed, then:
 
LARRY
(off Sara)
 
Okay, I'll talk to the monkey.
 
SARA
 
(annoyed)
 
Chimpanzee....  Not monkey! Chimpanzee!
 
There's an awkward silence, then:
RANDY
Hey, honest mistake.  No big deal.
 
LARRY
Okay... well.... Somebody grab the 
Chiiiiiiiiiimmmmp!
 
Larry leans forward in pain as he hugs Jobo.
 
LARRY
Oooooooh!  Ooooooooooh!

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              6.
CHERYL
 
(annoyed)
 
Larry, stop acting silly.
 
LARRY
(moaning)
 
Jooooobooooo!  Jooooooboooo.
Randy tries pulling Jobo away, but then realizes:
 
RANDY
Shit, he's got Larry by the balls!  Jobo, 
release!  Release!
 
Randy pries Jobo loose.  Larry gasps.
 
EXT. RANDY AND SARA'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 1)
Larry is in the passenger seat and Cheryl behind the wheel of 
their Prius.  Randy and Sara are outside of Larry's window.
SARA
 
Larry, I am so sorry.  Jobo's never done 
that to anyone!
 
LARRY
I'm fine.  Really.
 
RANDY
We’ll make it up to you tomorrow night.  
What's your favorite restaurant?
Larry looks at Cheryl, but she just smiles.
 
LARRY
I don't know--Pinot.
RANDY
Really?  Well, perfect, say seven-thirty?
SARA
 
Oh, you almost forgot your Jobo doll!
Sara sticks the Jobo doll in Larry's face and makes it a Nazi 
salute.  Larry takes the doll, and as he rolls up the window:
 
SARA
 
Bye, bye!
 
Cheryl drives off.  And after a few beats, she grins.
 
LARRY
Yeah, go ahead, smirk.  You're smirking 
and that monkey almost took away your 
greatest pleasure in life.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              7.
CHERYL
 
Oh really?  Well, maybe you should have 
talked to Jobo.
 
LARRY
It's a monkey!  It doesn't understand 
what we're saying!
 
CHERYL
 
You never know.
 
LARRY
One thing I do know, Sara is crazy, 
calling that monkey "baby."
 
CHERYL
 
She's just a little sensitive because she 
can't have her own kids.
LARRY
Why can’t she adopt a Chinese baby like 
everybody else?  You don’t go out and get 
lower forms of primates like you’ve been 
having monkey fucking fantasies. And you 
shouldn't have Jobo, the-balls-grabber, 
performing at the Children's Hospital 
either.
CHERYL
 
Jobo won't even be near the kids.
LARRY
He's clearly a vicious beast.
CHERYL
 
I'm head of the organizing committee, so 
they really are expecting me to deliver 
Jobo. Randy assured me he's never done 
anything like this, so I don't know why 
he grabbed you.
 
LARRY
I think he's gay.
 
CHERYL
 
Randy?  Because they can’t have kids?
LARRY
No, the monkey.  He grabbed my balls.  
And if you think he's smart enough to 
understand what people are saying, then 
he's smart enough to be gay.
CHERYL
 
So, that’s how it works.

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              8.
Larry picks up the Jobo doll.
LARRY
Notice how Sara insisted I take Nazi 
Monkey?  I bet you Randy is doing more 
than just wrangling animals over there. 
Probably cloning more Jobos. Creating a 
race of Nazi monkeys, like "The Boys In 
Brazil."
 
CHERYL
 
Are you through?
LARRY
Except, this is going to be more like 
"Planet of the Apes."  A master race of 
gay Nazi monkeys ruling the planet....  
That may not be too bad....  Yep.  I 
think I can deal with that.
 
Larry holds up the Jobo doll to Cheryl and makes it salute.
INT. RESTAURANT - EARLY MORNING (DAY 2)
 
Larry and his manager, JEFF, are at a table.
 
JEFF
 
I don't see why you just didn't talk to 
Jobo.  Monkeys aren't that far from 
humans.
LARRY
You want to know why I didn't talk to the 
monkey?  Because they were talking to him 
in baby talk, like it understands baby 
talk.  Babies don't even understand baby 
talk.
JEFF
 
Well, I talk to Jobo.
 
LARRY
Only because you represent him.
 
A WAITER puts a check folder on the table.  They stand to 
leave.
LARRY
I'm going to run to the john. Thanks for 
the breakfast.
JEFF
 
No problem.  Oh, did I tell you Randy and 
Jobo are having lunch with Harvey 
Weinstein on Friday?

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              9.
LARRY
Weinstein?  You never got me lunch with 
Weinstein.  You got a monkey lunch with 
Weinstein and not me?
 
JEFF
 
It's a publicity thing they set up.
 
LARRY
Yeah.  All I know is a monkey got a 
meeting with Harvey Weinstein.
 
Larry and Jeff head towards the restroom.
INT. RESTAURANT RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 2)
 
Larry is at the urinal taking a leak when Jeff enters.
 
JEFF
 
So, you want a meeting--
LARRY
Don't talk to me.
 
JEFF
 
Don't talk to--.
LARRY
Shush.
 
Larry finishes, then goes to the sink to wash his hands.
LARRY
I don't talk at the urinal.
 
JEFF
 
I've never heard of that rule.
 
LARRY
I didn't say it was a rule.  It's my 
thing.
 
JEFF
 
Anyway, you want to meet with Weinstein?
 
LARRY
Why not?  I have questions burning holes 
in my head for Harvey Weinstein.
JEFF
 
Okay, I'll get you a meeting.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              10.
LARRY
(smirking)
 
That's alright. I don't want to meet him.  
I mean, come on, the man's meeting with 
monkeys.
 
Larry finishes washing his hands, he steps back and notices a 
small urine droplet on the upper thigh of his pants leg.
LARRY
(re: droplet)
 
Oh, will you look at this?  Isn't this 
embarrassing?
 
JEFF
 
Well, you can only see it when you look 
at it.  Who looks down there?
LARRY
Wonderful.  First I find out a monkey's 
meeting with Harvey Weinstein and now I 
have to walk down Sunset with a urine 
spot on my pants.
 
JEFF
 
Maybe the monkey broke something when he 
grabbed you.
Jeff laughs.  Larry grabs a paper towel and tries wiping it 
dry.
 
LARRY
No, this is your fault.
JEFF
 
My fault?
 
LARRY
You talked to me.
 
JEFF
 
I always talk to you!
 
LARRY
Not at the urinal!  You were talking to 
me in the middle of the wiggle.  I never 
talk during the wiggle.  Your talking 
threw me off.
 
JEFF
 
What?  You count the wiggles?!
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              11.
LARRY
No, I don't count!  I just know when to 
stop, that is, if there isn't anyone 
talking to me!  Now look.  People are 
going to know I had a post-urinating 
drip.
 
JEFF
 
Here, I'll fix it.
 
Jeff wets his hand with water from the faucet and then flings 
droplets of water on Larry's upper pants and lower shirt.
 
LARRY
Shit, what'd you do that for?!
 
JEFF
 
I fixed it!  See!  Now it looks like sink 
splatter and not insufficient wiggling!  
Yeah?
LARRY
No one's going to buy this!  Have you 
ever done this?!
JEFF
 
What?  This?  Have "I" ever done this?
LARRY
Yes, you!
 
JEFF
 
All the time.
 
EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 2)
Larry and Jeff ad-lib good-byes as they leave the restaurant. 
Larry walks with his eyes glued on his "sink splatter" until 
he looks up for his car and:
LARRY
It was....  Where's my fucking car?!
 
(searches pockets)
 
Fuck, my Blackberry’s in the car.
An 
LAPD OFFICER
 happens by.
 
LARRY
Officer!  Somebody stole my car!
LAPD OFFICER
 
Okay, okay, calm down.
 
As the officer pulls out a note pad:
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              12.
LARRY
I was in there eating breakfast for no 
more than an hour!  I come out-- gone!  
Who steals a Prius?!
LAPD OFFICER
 
Okay.  What is your name, sir?
 
LARRY
Larry.  Larry David.
LAPD OFFICER
 
(writing it down)
 
Larry David....  And where did you last 
leave the car, Mr. David?
 
LARRY
Across the street.  At that meter. I'm 
absolutely sure of that.
The LAPD Officer glances down at Larry's sink splatter.
LARRY
It's... you know... sink splatter.
 
The officer looks suspiciously at Larry for a beat, then:
 
LAPD OFFICER
 
I don't think I can help you.
LARRY
What?  Why not?  It’s just sink splatter.
LAPD OFFICER
 
The car's not in my jurisdiction.
LARRY
What?  Grand theft auto is out of the 
jurisdiction of police now?
 
LAPD OFFICER
 
No.  It's just that, see your car was 
parked across the street in West 
Hollywood.
LARRY
So, it's legal to steal cars in West 
Hollywood?
LAPD OFFICER
 
No, this side of the street is the City 
of Los Angeles and I'm with the LAPD.  
You're going to have to contact the West 
Hollywood Sheriffs.

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              13.
LARRY
You gotta be kidding me.  You're really 
not going to help me?
 
LAPD OFFICER
 
(realizing)
Wait a minute.  Are you the Larry David 
of "Seinfeld"?
LARRY
Yes.  Does that matter?
LAPD OFFICER
 
Wow, you probably can afford to buy a 
fleet of cars.
LARRY
What are you saying?  I can afford to 
have my car stolen?
LAPD OFFICER
 
Oh, no, Mr. David.  It's just, I didn't 
really picture you driving a Prius.
 
The officer hands Larry a business card from his wallet.
LARRY
What's this?
(RE: card)
 
Jake Goldman, Mercedes Benz?
LAPD OFFICER
 
My uncle.  They have the new hybrid.
 
LARRY
I'm not a Benz guy.  What makes you think 
I want a Benz?
LAPD OFFICER
 
Hey, Benz makes a nice car.  Good luck.
 
The officer walks off as Larry looks on, frustrated.
 
INT. LARRY'S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING (DAY 2)
 
Cheryl is on the couch reading a magazine when Larry enters.
CHERYL
 
Larry, I'm glad you're home.  I was just 
on the phone with Sara and--
LARRY
Forget about Sara.  You won't believe my 
morning.  I had to take a cab home!  The 
car was stolen!
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              14.
CHERYL
 
The Prius?
LARRY
Yes.  Gone!  And my new cell was in it, 
too.  Do you know how helpless I felt 
without my cell?
CHERYL
 
Why didn't you just use a pay phone?
 
LARRY
A public phone?  Why don't I just dump my 
head in a vat of toxic waste?
 
CHERYL
 
Well, I'm just relieved to hear that 
because Sara called....
LARRY
Crazy Sara?
 
CHERYL
 
Yes.  Anyway, she said, get this-- she 
saw you, "gratifying" yourself in the 
Prius on Santa Monica Blvd.
 
LARRY
Gratifying....  You mean....
CHERYL
 
(nods)
Masturbating.
 
LARRY
Crazy Sara said she saw "me," on Santa 
Monica?...
CHERYL
 
Yes....  Driving through traffic.
LARRY
(chuckles)
 
Driving through traffic?  That wasn't me.
(then, realizing)
 
It must've been whoever stole our car!  
Who steals a Prius and masturbates in it?  
I mean, there's nothing erotic about that 
car. You'd have to be a sick fuck.
 
CHERYL
 
Pretty disturbing.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              15.
LARRY
After this, I hope they never find that 
car. I can’t drive that.
CHERYL
 
I’ll have to agree with you there.
 
LARRY
So, whoever stole it, must've looked like 
me.  Now that's creepy.
CHERYL
 
Well, Sara didn't actually see his face.
 
LARRY
No face?  What, she saw five fingers and 
a penis and assumed it was me?
 
CHERYL
 
Not exactly.  See, they have that SUV, 
the one that sits really high, so she 
couldn't see your face, but....
 
LARRY
So, she ID'ed my penis?  Sara's entire 
accusation is based on a penile I.D.?
CHERYL
 
And Jobo.
 
LARRY
Jobo?  What, the monkey saw me too?
 
CHERYL
 
No, the Jobo doll.  She could see it 
laying in the backseat.  That's how she 
knew it was our car.  But, hey, it wasn't 
you so... that's a relief.
 
Larry stares at Cheryl for a beat.
 
LARRY
You thought it was me.
 
CHERYL
 
What?
LARRY
You thought it was me Sara saw.
 
CHERYL
 
Hey, I think I know you, Larry.
 
LARRY
Then what's with all the relief?
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              16.
CHERYL
 
Relief?
LARRY
When I said the car was stolen, you said, 
"I'm relieved to hear that." And just 
now, you said, "So, that's a relief." 
Obviously you're relieved because... 
because you thought your husband was 
driving down Santa Monica Blvd. whacking 
off!
 
CHERYL
 
No... not at first.
LARRY
You agreed with Crazy Sarah!
CHERYL
 
I mean, just for an instant.  Sara saw 
Jobo... and, you know, I don't know how 
one reacts after....  That monkey grabbed 
you pretty hard.
LARRY
You think the reaction to having a monkey 
grab my balls is to drive down Santa 
Monica Blvd. whacking off?
 
CHERYL
 
(smirking)
 
Hey, I don't know how guys' minds work.
 
LARRY
Okay, Cheryl.  I'm glad you're taking 
this seriously.  If Jobo wasn't scheduled 
to be at the Children's Hospital, you 
would have said, "Sara, that was not my 
husband you saw you monkey-loving crazy 
woman."
CHERYL
 
Okay, I'll call Sara and tell her it 
wasn't you, alright?
Cheryl grabs the phone and dials.
LARRY
Yes.  Now.  You never know who else Crazy 
might blab this to.
CHERYL
 
I'm getting voice mail.
(into phone)
 
Hello, Sara.  It's Cheryl David. 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              17.
That wasn't Larry you saw. Get this-our 
Prius was stolen.  So, you saw our car 
with the Jobo doll in it, but that wasn't 
Larry, uh... humping the horn, and well, 
the car and the Jobo doll are gone, so, 
the good news is, we're still on for 
dinner, 7:30 tonight, okay?  Bye.
LARRY
"Humping the horn?"
CHERYL
 
That's what Sara called it.
 
SFX: PHONE RINGS
CHERYL
 
Maybe that's her now.
 
Cheryl picks up the phone.
 
CHERYL
 
(into phone)
 
Hello.... Hold on.
 
(to Larry)
 
For you.  It's the Sheriffs.
Larry slowly takes the phone.
LARRY
Hello.... Yes.... Oh, alright.  I know 
where that is....  Thank you, officer.  
Bye.
 
(to Cheryl)
Found it.  Fucking Lo-Jack.
 
CHERYL
 
Too bad.
 
LARRY
Can you drop me off at the police 
impound?
 
CHERYL
 
Sure.
LARRY
Did you know that one side of Sunset is 
West Hollywood and right across the 
street, it's Los Angeles?
 
CHERYL
 
Uh-huh.  I knew that.
 
LARRY
Oh.  You never said anything to me.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              18.
EXT. SHERIFF'S IMPOUND LOT - SOME TIME LATER (DAY 2)
 
Larry stands next to the Prius as the 
LOT ATTENDANT 
hands him 
a clipboard with papers to sign.
LOT ATTENDANT
 
Sign here.
LARRY
Okay....
 
(signing)
 
So, did you guys find prints or my phone 
in the car?
 
LOT ATTENDANT
 
The only thing found in it was a monkey 
doll dressed like a Nazi.
 
The Lot Attendant gives Larry a judgemental once over.
 
LARRY
So, while dusting for prints, did they 
find traces of anything else?
LOT ATTENDANT
 
Like, what?  Drugs?
LARRY
No....  Someone in it might have been, 
you know... humping the horn.
LOT ATTENDANT
 
Humping?
 
LARRY
The horn.  You see what I'm saying?
 
The Lot Attendant stares at Larry bewildered for a beat, 
then:
LARRY
(sotto)
 
Traces of sperm....  I'm talking sperm.
 
LOT ATTENDANT
 
Look, are you taking this car or what?
LARRY
Yeah.... You don't happen to have rubber 
gloves and a plastic tarp or something I 
can lay on the front seat?
 
LOT ATTENDANT
 
Whatever turns you on.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              19.
INT. MOBILE PHONE STORE - LATER (DAY 2)
 
Larry is talking to a deadpan 
SALESWOMAN
.
SALESWOMAN
So, you don't need me to show you how to 
use this phone?
 
LARRY
No.  This is just like my old cell.
 
SALESWOMAN
You might want to get a Bluetooth, too.
 
LARRY
Bluetooth?  What are you saying?  The 
phone causes cancer?
SALESWOMAN
I advise everyone buying a phone to get a 
headset.  It's legal when you're driving.
LARRY
What if I'm not driving?
SALESWOMAN
I would still advise you to get a 
headset.
 
LARRY
Because it causes cancer, right?! Shit, 
shit!  I'm always on my cell!
(feels his skull)
 
You think it's too late?!
 
SALESWOMAN
Sir, calm down.  It doesn't cause cancer.  
I get a commission so I try to push all 
our products. Okay?
LARRY
Oh.  Of course.  You're a salesperson.  
That makes sense. Very good.  You are 
very good.  You almost sold me.  Whew.  
I'll just take the phone, okay?
 
SALESWOMAN
(deadpan)
 
I would strongly advise you to get the 
headset.
 
EXT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP - AFTERNOON (DAY 2)
 
Larry drives up and parks the Prius on the street in front of 
a Mercedes Benz dealership.  

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              20.
He's wearing gloves and there is plastic on the front seat.  
He's talking to Cheryl on his new cell phone through a 
Bluetooth headset on his left ear.
 
LARRY
(loud)
Cheryl, I can't hear shit with this 
headset, but it was strongly advised!
(louder)
Strongly advised!...
Larry steps out of the car, still wearing the rubber gloves.
LARRY
(loud)
Yes, they left the Nazi Monkey!...
 
Larry grabs the Jobo doll from the front seat, squeezes it 
until it salutes.
 
LARRY
(loud)
Look, I'm at the Mercedes dealer! I have 
get to rid of this car!... Yes, I know, 
what else could you have thought with 
Crazy Sara telling you all those 
things!...
 
Sara drives up next to Larry in a SUV.  From her POV, she 
cannot see the Bloothtooth on the opposite side of Larry's 
head, so to her it looks like he's yelling to the Jobo doll 
that he's holding.
 
LARRY
(loud)
Yes, I know you love me!  I love you, 
too!
 
Larry spots Sara in the SUV.
LARRY
Hey, Sara--
 
Larry waves the Jobo doll at Sara.
 
LARRY
I got Jobo!  I got Jobo!
Sara burns rubber as she drives off through a red light. 
Larry doesn't know what to make of it.
LARRY
(loud, to headset)
 
That was Sara.  She's crazy.
Larry tosses the Jobo doll back into the car.

INT. MERCEDES BENZ DEALER - LATER - (DAY 2)
 
Larry looks at Mercedes in the showroom as a very 
distinguished dealer, 
JAKE GOLDMAN
, 60, stands behind him.
 
LARRY
You know, I never really thought about 
buying a Benz until today.  It’s the new 
hybrid.
JAKE
 
Are you sure you want to buy a "German" 
car?
 
LARRY
I might want a test drive first.
JAKE
 
You want to test drive this "German" car 
before you purchase?
Larry turns and looks at Jake, a bit perplexed.
LARRY
It may be me, but why do you keep putting 
an emphasis on German when you say it?
JAKE
 
You think I'm emphasizing "German"? Why 
would that be?
LARRY
I don't know.  You're the one doing it.
 
JAKE
 
Tell me something, Mr. David. You're a 
Jew, right?
 
LARRY
And?
 
JAKE
 
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
 
LARRY
What?  Nothing?  Then why--
 
JAKE
 
No, no.  It's just that I find it very 
"interesting" that "you" would want to 
buy a "German" car.
LARRY
Are you saying because I'm Jewish I 
shouldn't be buying a German car?
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              22.
JAKE
 
I didn't say that.  I said, I find it... 
"interesting."
LARRY
(chuckles)
 
You know what I find "interesting," Mr. 
"Goldman"?  The person telling me it's 
"interesting" that a “Jew” wants to buy a 
"German" car, is a "Jew" who's selling a 
"German" car. That's "interesting."
 
JAKE
 
Mr. David, I know you're not a very 
religious man.
LARRY
You do not know that.  How do you know 
that?
JAKE
 
Believe me, we know.
LARRY
We?
JAKE
 
You're not anonymous.
 
LARRY
This is insane!  If you think these cars 
are being built by Nazis, you shouldn't 
be selling them at all!
JAKE
 
Let’s just say I'm working for us on the 
inside, alright?  Now, I don't ask this 
of all Jews who come in. But you, a man 
of your success is a pillar of the 
community.  A role model.  So, let me 
take you across the street and buy a nice 
American car.
 
LARRY
(calling out)
 
Uh, can somebody help me out here?!
 
EXT. STREET - LATER THAT AFTERNOON (DAY 2)
Larry is at a stop light in his Mercedes when 
RICHARD LEWIS
 
walks by in the cross walk and spots him.
RICHARD
 
Larry, what the hell are you doing?!
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              23.
LARRY
Hey, Richard!  I'm cruising in my new 
Mercedes!  Get in!
 
RICHARD
 
Get in?!  I'm not getting in that! It's a 
fucking Benz!
 
LARRY
What's wrong with you?!  Just get in the 
car!
 
Richard tries walking away.  Larry blows the horn.
RICHARD
 
Okay!  Okay!
Richard pulls down his shades, gets in and slouches in the 
seat.  Larry drives off.
 
RICHARD
 
You bought a Benz?  How could you?! I 
thought I knew you, Larry!
 
LARRY
What!  You used to own a Mercedes!
 
RICHARD
 
That was before my trip to Israel!
 
LARRY
What's with Jews not buying Mercedes?  If 
Jews didn't buy Mercedes, the company 
would go out of business!
 
RICHARD
 
Exactly!
 
The car is nearing a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
 
RICHARD
 
Let me out.  Let me out!
LARRY
Out?  You feel this nice ride?
 
RICHARD
 
Shit, I know, okay!  But let me out!  
Drop me off at the Coffee Bean!
 
LARRY
How about I drive you to a Coffee Bean in 
Santa Monica?
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              24.
RICHARD
 
No.  No one makes double espressos like 
this Coffee Bean.
 
LARRY
What do you mean?  It's a chain. They all 
make coffee alike.
 
RICHARD
 
No, trust me.  No one makes double 
espressos like this one, so just let me 
out of your Nazi car before somebody sees 
me.
LARRY
Fine.
The car comes to a stop.  Richard gets out.
 
RICHARD
 
Never pick me up in this again!
 
As Richard turns to go towards the Coffee Bean, two Hasidic 
Jews pass.  Richard lifts up his jacket to cover his face as 
he heads towards the Coffee Bean.
INT. LARRY'S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING(DAY 2)
 
Larry walks in.  Cheryl is on the couch reading.
 
LARRY
Cheryl, the Mercedes drives great.
 
CHERYL
 
Randy called.  Apparently, Sara is very 
upset because of you.
 
LARRY
What did I do now that I never did in the 
first place?
CHERYL
 
She thinks you're crazy.  She told Randy 
she saw you cooing over the Jobo doll and 
telling it "I love you."
LARRY
I was talking to you, not the Nazi 
Monkey!
CHERYL
 
Well, she thinks I made up the stolen car 
story as an alibi for your joyride down 
Santa Monica Blvd.
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              25.
LARRY
Didn't you explain it to Randy?
 
CHERYL
 
Yes.  But I don't know if he believed me.  
He just said to please bring the Jobo 
doll with us to dinner.  Sara wants it 
back. But I don't think we should go to 
dinner.  Or maybe you shouldn't go.
 
LARRY
Me?  If I don't go they'll think I'm 
lying about all this.
 
CHERYL
 
I don't know.  It's been bad karma 
between you and Sara since Jobo grabbed 
you.   And I really promised them Jobo at 
the hospital. I don't want you to screw 
it up.
 
LARRY
You say it like it's my fault.
 
CHERYL
 
I said bad karma.
 
LARRY
Randy and Jobo are having lunch with 
Harvey Weinstein tomorrow.  What if Randy 
tells Weinstein I was whacking off on 
Santa Monica Blvd.?
CHERYL
 
Randy is going to bring up whacking off 
with Harvey Weinstein?
 
LARRY
Who knows?  That could very well come up 
at lunch, especially with a monkey at the 
table.  Monkey-- spank the Monkey.  It's 
a logical leap.
 
CHERYL
 
That’s ridiculous, Larry.
 
LARRY
Shit!  When I traded in the Prius, I left 
Nazi Monkey in it.  We'll have to stop by 
the Mercedes dealer to pick it up on the 
way to dinner.
CHERYL
 
This is a bad idea.

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              26.
LARRY
Look, we don't even have to stay for 
dinner.  After I explain what happened, 
I'll say I'm sick-- my crotch hurts... 
because of Jobo.
CHERYL
 
Your crotch hurts?
 
LARRY
Yes, that's the signal.  When I say, my 
crotch hurts, grab your purse, because we 
are out.
 
Off Cheryl’s doubting look:
 
INT. PINOT - NIGHT (DAY 2)
 
Larry and Cheryl are waiting patiently.  Larry drinks his 
water.  Cheryl checks her watch.
LARRY
They lied.  No one stole Nazi Monkey.  
That Nazi Monkey is somewhere at that 
Mercedes dealership.
CHERYL
 
Why would the car salesmen lie about 
something like that?  You bought a 
Mercedes from them.
LARRY
I'm a Jew with a Nazi Monkey that bought 
a Mercedes from them.  I'm an outcast 
now, Cheryl.  They may throw me out of 
temple.
CHERYL
 
You have to go to temple before they 
throw you out.
 
Randy walks up to the table in a huff.
LARRY
Hi, Randy.  Where's the lovely Sara?
 
RANDY
(pissed off)
 
Waiting for me in the car, crying!  We 
were going to let this go until you left 
that phone message!
LARRY
Message?  What message?

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              27.
Randy sits at the table.
 
RANDY
Let me refresh your memory: "Lick me, 
Jobo."
 
LARRY
What?
RANDY
"Lick me, Jobo."
LARRY
"Lick me, Jobo?"  You think I left you a 
message saying, "Lick me, Jobo?"
RANDY
Don't deny it!  I have your voice 
recorded.
 
Randy pulls out a micro cassette recorder and plays it.
RECORDED VOICE
(moaning)
 
Liiiick meeeee, Jooooboooo. Liiiick 
meeeee, Jooooboooo.  Liiiiiiick 
meeeeeeee, Jooooboooooo!
LARRY
That's not me!  If I were going to leave 
an obscene message, I think I would be a 
little more creative than, "Lick me, 
Jobo."
 
RANDY
Don't fuck with me!  Your cell phone 
number was on our caller I.D.!
 
LARRY
My cell was stolen with the car! I listed 
your number under Jobo! That's how they 
called you!
 
CHERYL
 
Right.  Show him your new phone.
Larry slowly pulls out a Blackberry that looks just like his 
last one.
 
RANDY
That's the same fucking phone!
 
LARRY
(to Cheryl)
I bought the same phone.

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              28.
RANDY
Say it!
LARRY
Say what?
 
RANDY
"Lick me, Jobo."  Prove that it it's not 
you.
 
LARRY
I'm not saying that.
RANDY
Come on.  Moan it.  Like you did on the 
tape.
(moans)
 
Liiiick meeeee, Jooooobooooo.
People are looking.  Larry looks at Cheryl who nods.
 
CHERYL
 
So we can leave.
LARRY
(slight moan)
 
Liick, mee, Jooboo.
RANDY
No!  Like the tape.  Moan it like you 
mean it!
 
LARRY
Liiiiick, meeeeee, Jooooobooooo. 
Liiiiick, meeeeee, Jooooobooooo.
 
RANDY
See?
 
LARRY
See what?
 
RANDY
You and your lying wife are crazy. So, 
you can forget about Jobo performing at 
the Children's Hospital!  And if you or 
she comes near us again, it will get 
nasty-- real nasty.
Randy turns to leave but then stops.
 
RANDY
Where's the fucking Jobo doll?!
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              29.
LARRY
You're not going to believe this-- it was 
stolen again.  But, there's a bright 
side.  That may mean it's going to be a 
big seller.
 
Randy storms out.  After Cheryl stares at Larry for a beat:
LARRY
I think he believed me....
 
CHERYL
 
Larry... I'm the only one who believes 
you.
 
LARRY
Good....  Well, my crotch hurts.
EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT (DAY 2)
Larry and Cheryl are driving back in the Mercedes when Larry 
pulls over and parks near a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
CHERYL
 
What, you suddenly need a latte?
LARRY
Restroom.  I had all that water at Pinot.  
Did you know this Coffee Bean makes the 
best double espressos in the city?  Did 
you know that?
CHERYL
 
Yes I did, Larry.
 
LARRY
How come you never tell me anything?
 
CHERYL
  
I'll just wait out here to make sure the 
Benz isn't stolen.
 
Larry gets out of the car.
 
INT. COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF - MOMENTS LATER (DAY 2)
 
People wait in line.  Larry enters and heads to the bathroom, 
but stops when he spots the Jobo doll on a table.  Larry 
picks it up then suspiciously eyes the patrons in the cafe. 
After a beat, he goes to the 
BARRISTA
 who’s making coffee.
 
LARRY
Excuse me, but did you see who left this 
doll at that table?

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              30.
The Barrista stops working.
 
BARRISTA
 
You a cop?  Was it involved in a crime?  
Trying to track down the evidence trail 
like they do in "Law and Order, huh?"  
That's a good show.
 
LARRY
Look, I'm not a cop.
BARRISTA
 
Prosecutor?
 
LARRY
Have you seen anyone who might have been 
a little suspicious?
The Barrista goes back to making coffee.
 
BARRISTA
 
If you're not a cop, I'm really busy, 
mister.
Larry eyes the rest of the room.  No one looks suspicious, so 
he exits into the bathroom.  Just then, Cheryl walks in and 
stands in line.
 
INT. COFFEE BEAN RESTROOM - A MOMENT LATER (DAY 2)
There is a stall and one urinal.  Larry is at the urinal. The 
Jobo doll is on the sink counter.
INT. COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF - A MOMENT LATER (DAY 2)
 
Randy and Sara enter and stand behind Cheryl.  They notice 
each other, then:
 
CHERYL
 
Oh, Sara, Randy... I'm so sorry, but let 
me explain....
INT. COFFEE BEAN RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS (DAY 2)
Larry is washing his hands when he notices a urine spot on 
his pants.  He tries drying it in vein, then attempts to 
sprinkle water on his pants, but douses them with way too 
much water.  There is a toilet flush and out of the stall 
steps a shocked Jake, the Mercedes dealer.  Larry eyes Jake, 
the Jobo doll and then Jake.
LARRY
(realizing)
I don't believe it.  You stole Nazi 
Monkey!

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              31.
JAKE
 
(caught)
Ah,..., well...
 
Then as Jake slowly creeps towards the door:
 
JAKE
 
(turning tables)
It was your Nazi Monkey?!    First you 
buy a Mercedes, and then I discovered you 
have a monkey dressed as a Nazi!
INT. COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF - CONTINUOUS (DAY 2)
Cheryl, Randy and Sara are still in line.
CHERYL
 
So, some one at the Mercedes dealer must 
have stolen the Jobo doll, so you can see 
how all this must look.
SARA
 
You're right.  I'm so sorry, Cheryl.  You 
must think so horribly of me....
JAKE (O.S.)
You disgust me!  I hope you and your 
little friend have fun driving around in 
your fancy car, but for the book, I find 
you disgusting!
 
Jake enters the cafe and storms pass the three as he exits. A 
few beats later, Larry enters the cafe as he tries absorbing 
the excess water from his pants with the head of the Jobo 
doll until he looks up and sees Randy, Sara and Cheryl 
staring at him, rubbing himself dry with the Jobo doll.  
Larry holds up the Jobo doll.
 
LARRY
I found Jobo!
 
SARA
 
Oh, my God.  He's doing it!
 
Larry realizes that all eyes are still on his wet spot.
LARRY
It's sink splatter!  Sink splatter!
 
RANDY
You perverted fuck!
As Randy and Sara head out the door:
 

Curb Your Enthusiasm  - “The Jobo Doll” 
              32.
LARRY
Jobo wasn't licking me!
Cheryl glares at Larry.  Then after a beat:
 
LARRY
You were right.  Bad bad Karma.... 
Baaaaaad.... Mad?  I should have stayed 
home.  Yep, I can admit that.
Cheryl shakes her head and exits out the door, leaving Larry 
standing there with the Jobo doll.  An 
OLD SCRUNGY HOMELESS 
MAN
 is sitting at a table next to Larry.  He looks at Larry's 
"sink splatter."
OLD SCRUNGY HOMELESS MAN
(chuckles)
 
I have that same problem.
 
Larry covers the wet spot with the Jobo doll and slowly exits 
out the door.
 
FADE OUT:
 
END OF SHOW
